# Frontend with Next.js

This repository contains the code for a frontend developed in Next.js. The primary purpose of this project is to learn to use Next.js for building scalable frontend applications that integrate with a backend developed in Nest.js.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a robust and scalable frontend that integrates with a backend developed in Nest.js. The backend includes functionalities such as user registration and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Backend Project

The backend project can be found at the following link: [championship_backend](https://github.com/mellussonahuel/championship_backend)

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Implemented Functionalities

- **User Registration**: Interface for registering new users.
- **User Authentication**: Interface for authenticating users using JWT.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application works on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:nahuelmellusso/championship_frontend.git
```

Install proyect

```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
